# Clustering-Animations-using-Machine-Learning-algorithm
In this project, I used different algorithms from supervised learning to predict and classify in order to fill null values of some important attributes.
I used a neural network with SoftMax activation to classify the null values of a categorical attribute and a neural network with polynomial regression to predict the null values of a numerical attribute.
after preprocessing and hot-code encoding the important values of categorical attributes I used a clustering algorithm to make three groups of movies.
A, B, and C clusters of movies are associated by rating, popularity, members, and other factors.
The point was to check the underrated movies with high scores in the cC cluster.
